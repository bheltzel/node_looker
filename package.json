  "description": "### Authorization\n\nThe Looker API uses Looker **API3** credentials for authorization and access control. Looker admins can\ncreate API3 credentials on Looker's **Admin/Users** page. Pass API3 credentials to the **/login** endpoint to\nobtain a temporary access_token. Include that access_token in the Authorization header of Looker API requests.\nFor details, see [Looker API Authorization](https://looker.com/docs/r/api/authorization)\n\n### Client SDKs\n\nThe Looker API is a RESTful system that should be usable by any programming language capable of making\nHTTPS requests. Client SDKs for a variety of programming languages can be generated from the Looker API's Swagger\nJSON metadata to streamline use of the Looker API in your applications. A client SDK for Ruby is available\nas an example. For more information, see [Looker API Client SDKs](https://looker.com/docs/r/api/client_sdks)\n\n### Try It Out!\n\nThe 'api-docs' page served by the Looker instance includes 'Try It Out!' buttons for each API method. After logging\nin with API3 credentials, you can use the \"Try It Out!\" buttons to call the API directly from the documentation\npage to interactively explore API features and responses.\n\n### Versioning\n\nFuture releases of Looker will expand this API release-by-release to securely expose more and more of the core\npower of Looker to API client applications. API endpoints marked as \"beta\" may receive breaking changes without\nwarning. Stable (non-beta) API endpoints should not receive breaking changes in future releases.\nFor more information, see [Looker API Versioning](https://looker.com/docs/r/api/versioning)\n",
